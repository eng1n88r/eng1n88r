# Hi there

I’m **Viktar Hushchynski**, a software engineer with almost two decades of experience in turning caffeine into clean code (most of the time). When I’m not busy building scalable enterprise solutions or tinkering with cloud architectures, you can probably find me debugging something I swore “worked on my machine” or experimenting with IoT devices and firmware just to see what sparks.

## What I do:
- **Design and build cloud-based solutions in Azure** ☁️  
- **Architect RESTful APIs** because who doesn’t love a good API?  
- **Tinker with IoT devices, hardware, and firmware** — because why settle for just writing software when you can mess with the hardware too?  
- **Write code** that future me (hopefully) won’t regret.  

---

## Fun facts:
- My IoT projects range from _“functional and awesome”_ to _“why is it blinking like that?”_.  
- I believe in _“works smarter, not just harder”_ — unless it’s 3 AM and the CI/CD pipeline is down.  
- My GitHub stats may not be very impressive, but that’s only because the real magic is locked away in private repos, organization projects, and late-night experiments that never made it here.

## Take a look around!  
These public repositories offer a glimpse of what I’ve been experimenting with in my spare time. If you want to chat about real-world systems, scalable solutions, or IoT adventures, feel free to **reach out**!
