# Hi there

I'm **Viktar Hushchynski**, a software engineer with close to twenty years of experience. I spend most of my time building enterprise systems and cloud infrastructure, but I also get into IoT, hardware, and firmware on the side — I like knowing what's happening all the way down the stack.

## What I work on
- Cloud architecture and solutions in Azure
- RESTful API design
- IoT devices, hardware, and firmware
- Generally trying to write code I won't hate in six months

---

## A few things worth mentioning
- Most of my work lives in private repos and org projects, so what you see here is just side projects and experiments.
- My IoT builds range from genuinely useful to "well, it was worth a shot."
- I'm always up for a good conversation about systems design, scalability, or anything embedded.

## Have a look around
These public repos are mostly things I've been playing with in my spare time. If anything catches your eye or you want to talk shop, feel free to reach out.

Also, if you're up for it — check out [Battle Snakes](https://battle-snakes.com). It's a fun one.
